# My Pumpkin Soup
My pumpkin soup. Perfect for cold days.

## Ingredients

* 1 can Coconut Milk
* 1 tablespoon Curry Paste (from the Thai shop, I usually use red or massaman
  curry paste)
* 1 medium sized Pumpkin (e.g. Hokaido)
* 3 medium sized Potatoes 
* 2 Onions
* 2 cloves Garlic 
* 1 thumb sized piece Ginger
* Broth (I use vegetable broth)
* Oil (I usually use rapeseed oil)
* Chillies to your liking

## Preparation

1. Wash vegetables. Chop onions, chillies, garlic, and ginger. Cut pumpkin and
   potatoes into pieces.
2. Heat the oil and fry the chopped things. After around 5 minutes, add the curry paste,
   fry for another 3 minutes. Add potatoes and pumpkin and continue frying for
   a few minutes, nothing should burn! 
3. Add broth so that everything is covered. Boil until the pumpkin and potatoes
   are soft (takes usually around 20 minutes).
4. Blend the soup to your liking, add coconut milk, bring to a boil, lower to
   medium heat, simmer for a while. 
5. Enjoy with bread.
