A tasty dish from the Middle East, many versions exist, but I usually cook it with eggs and chickpeas.
	

## Ingredients

* 1 can Tomatoes, minced and peeled
* 3 Eggs, medium size
* 1 can Chickpeas
* 1 Bellpepper, red
* 1 Onion, middlesized 
* 2 Garlic cloves
* 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
* 1 tablespoon Harissa
* 1 tablespoon Tomato Paste
* 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon Paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* a few branches Italian Parsley (can be replace by Coriander)


## Preparation
1. Wash bellpepper and parsley. Finely chop the garlic, onions, and bellpepper. Crush the cumin seeds in a mortar and mix with the other dry spices. 
2. Heat the oil to medium-high heat, fry the onions for a while, then add bellpepper and garlic. Add the spices while stiring constantly and roast for one minute. 
3. Add the tomatoes, harissa, and tomato paste, season to taste with salt and pepper. Let it come to a boil, reduce the heat and cover with a lid. 
4. The longer the sauce is cooked, the better its taste, but in principle the chickpeas can be added after around ten minutes. Cook for another ten minutes.
5. Create three "indentations" in the middle of the sauce with a spoon and fill with the eggs. Cover the pan and cook for about five minutes.
6. Add chopped parsley or coriander, serve with bread.
