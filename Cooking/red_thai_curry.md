# Red Thai Curry  
This is just a basic recipe for a vegetarian red Thai curry that can be expanded in many ways.


## Ingredients

* 1 can Coconut Milk
* 2 tablespoons Red Curry Paste (from the Thai shop)
* 3 portions Vegetables/Tofu to your liking
* 1 teaspoon Fishsauce
* 1/2 teaspoon Palm Sugar
* 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil (I usually use rapeseed oil)
* 1 handful of Cashews or Peanuts (unroasted, unsalted)
* a few branches of Thai Basil


## Preparation

1. Wash vegetables and Thai basil. Cut the vegetables into mouthsized pieces. Roast the cashews or peanuts on low to medium heat constantly stiring, then put them aside. 
2. Heat the oil and roast the curry paste on medium heat until it starts to smell. If you want to have a little bit more peanut flavour, you can add a tablespoon peanutbutter.
3. Gradually add the coconut milk while stirring, so that no lumps of the paste remain.
4. Add fishsauce and palm sugar to taste, let the curry come to a boil, lower the heat and cover the wok with a lid.
5. Sequentially add vegetables to the covered wok according to their needed time. For example, let potatoes boil for 5 minutes and then add broccoli and cook for another 5 minutes, so that none of them overcook.
6. Add chopped Thai basil and nuts, serve with Jasmin rice.
