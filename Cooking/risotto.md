# Risotto
My own vegetable risotto recipe.
	

## Ingredients

* 300 grams Risotto Rice (e.g. Carnaroli)
* one portion of Vegetables (e.g. Zucchini, Carrot)
* a few Dried Tomatoes 
* a few fresh leaves of Salvia
* 2 Onions, middlesized 
* 2 Garlic cloves
* Broth (I usually use vegetable broth)
* White wine to taste (I use about 3dl)
* Grated parmesan to taste
* Salt and Pepper to taste


## Preparation
1. Chop onions and garlic. Cut vegetables into mouthsized pieces. 
2. Heat the oil to medium-high heat, fry the onions for a while. Add garlic,
   dried tomatoes, salvia. After a while also add vegetables, stir so that
   nothing burns. 
3. Add the rice, stir constantly, add the white wine. 
4. Reduce to medium heat, after most of the wine is gone, refil with broth so
   that everything is covered. Stir and continue to refill the pot with broth
   for about 15 minutes.
5. Taste if the rice is cooked well enough (I like it a little bit more on the
   al dente side) 
6. Add a small piece of butter and grated parmesan to your liking.
   Season with salt and pepper.
